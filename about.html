        <h2>What is Velocity?</h2>
        <p>There is a tremendous amount of hype surrounding cryptocurrencies in the 21st century. However, it seems at times 
            that there is simply too much information to comprehend. What are cryptocurrencies? Are they speculative assets or a 
            new anarcholibertarian means of value exchange? Are they for common people or criminals? Should you invest in crypto? 
            If so, how?
        </p>
        <p>
            This application seeks to solve one tiny piece of this puzzle: how can we understand the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies?
            In principle, there are many metrics to understand the intrinsic validity of a currency: the stability of a government, the 
            level of free market freedom, its adoption, etc. However, for this project we are focusing on one fundamental metric: the velocity of money,
            defined as the total productive output of a currency. In words, this can be expressed by the total number of transactions 
            multiplied by the average amount exchnaged per transaction divided by its total money supply. If transaction data is not readily
            available, then token market capitalization should serve as a sufficient proxy for the productive output of the currency. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, the goal of this application is to source data from the LunarCrush API and calculate the following metrics for a given cryptoasset:
            <ul>
                <li>Current Price Data</li>
                <li>24-hour Price Change</li>
                <li>Velocity</li>
                <li>Number of Transactions per day</li>
                <li>Social Velocity</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The above data will provide meaningful insights into the degree to which an token is a speculative asset or a currency relative to
            another currency. This should thus enable users to identify coins that exhibit more stable behavior and thus pose a smaller intrinsic
            risk as an initial investment. Comparing the velocity and social velocity in particular will provide a meaningful way to identify market
            manias and ensure you (the investor) do not fall subject to the infamous "Buy High, Sell Low" Club. 
        </p>
        <p>Note: this investment strategy is fundamentally contrary to the present mode of crypto investing, which is essentially 
            high-stakes gambling. However, a value-driven investment approach on a broader level should lead to less market volatility and therefore
        greater intrinsic public trust in crypto assets as a unit of exchange rather than simply as a speculative entity.</p>
