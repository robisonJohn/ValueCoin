            <h3>About Velocity</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this application is to encourage intelligent investing in the space of crypto assets by synthesizing a tremendous
                quantity of market data into comprehensible quantitiatve metrics and visualizations. Presently, it is in
                its beta form. As the application grows, the goal is to create an intuitive user-interface which enables users to make buy and sell
                orders in real time based on the user's knowledge, interest, time investment, risk-tolerance, etc. As accessibility grows within the
                crypto space, so it will shift away from highly volatile "punting" and towards reasoned market decisions that create more stable and
                trustworthy markets. This, in turn, will facilitate mainstream adoption for this revolutionary technology.

            <h3>About the Developer</h3>
            <p>This application has been developed by John Robison, a senior at Columbia University studying mathematics and statistics. His primary 
                interests include number theory and its applications to mathematical cryptography, behavorial economics, blockchain technology, and 
                machine learning. He has held roles at NASA conducting research into statistical machine learning methods for climate research 
                (2020) and at the Blockchain Research Institute exploring DeFi and its implications for C-Suite Executives (2021-Present). In 
                his free time, he enjoys science fiction and fantasy in all its various mediums (books, films, etc.), running in 
                Central Park, playing with dogs, and exploring the mobius strip that is New York City.
