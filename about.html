            <h3>About Velocity</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this application is to encourage intelligent investing in the space of crypto assets by synthesizing a tremendous
                quantity of market data into comprehensible quantitiatve metrics and visualizations. Presently, it is in
                its beta form. As the application grows, the goal is to create an intuitive user-interface which enables users to make buy and sell
                orders in real time based on the user's knowledge, interest, time investment, risk-tolerance, etc. As accessibility grows within the
                crypto space, so it will shift away from highly volatile "punting" and towards reasoned market decisions that create more stable and
                trustworthy markets. This, in turn, will facilitate mainstream adoption for this revolutionary technology.
