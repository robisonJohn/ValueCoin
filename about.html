        <h3>What is Velocity?</h3>
        <p>There is a tremendous amount of hype surrounding cryptocurrencies in the 21st century. However, it seems at times 
            that there is simply too much information to comprehend. What are cryptocurrencies? Are they speculative assets or a 
            new anarcholibertarian means of value exchange? Are they for common people or criminals? Should you invest in crypto? 
            If so, how?
        </p>
        <p>
            This application seeks to solve one tiny piece of this puzzle: namely, how can we understand the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies?
            In principle, there are many metrics to understand the intrinsic validity of a currency: the stability of a government, the 
            level of free market freedom, its level of adoption, etc. However, for this project we are focusing on one fundamental metric: 
            the velocity of money. According to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/velocity.asp">Investopedia</a>, the velocity of
            money is " a measurement of the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy. It is the number of times that money moves from one entity to 
            another. It also refers to how much a unit of currency is used in a given period of time. Simply put, it's the rate at which consumers 
            and businesses in an economy collectively spend money." As an equation, this can be expressed by the following:
            <div>
                <img src="https://cdn.wallstreetmojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Quantity-Theory-of-Money-1.jpg" alt="Equation for Velocity of Money">
            </div>
            
            
            In words, this can be expressed by the total number of transactions multiplied by the price level divided by the total amount 
            of currency presently in circulation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, the goal of this application is to source data from the LunarCrush API and calculate the following metrics for a given cryptoasset:
            <ul>
                <li>Current Price Data</li>
                <li>24-hour Price Change</li>
                <li>Velocity</li>
                <li>Number of Transactions per day</li>
                <li>Social Velocity</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The above data will provide meaningful insights into the degree to which an token is a speculative asset or a store of value relative to
            another cryptocurrency. This should thus enable users to identify coins that exhibit more stable behavior and thus pose a smaller intrinsic
            risk as an initial investment. Comparing the velocity and social velocity in particular will provide a meaningful way to identify market
            manias and ensure you (the investor) do not fall subject to the infamous "Buy High, Sell Low" Club. 
        </p>
        <p>Note: this investment strategy is fundamentally contrary to the present mode of crypto investing, which is essentially 
            high-stakes gambling focused on "punting" coins with low values so you risk low losses but stand to gain tremendously. 
            However, a value-driven investment approach on a broader level should lead to less market volatility and therefore
            greater intrinsic public trust in crypto assets as a unit of exchange rather than simply as a speculative entity.</p>

        <h3>About the Developer</h3>
        <p>This application has been developed by John Robison, a senior at Columbia University studying mathematics and statistics. His primary 
            interests include number theory and its applications to mathematical cryptography, behavorial economics, blockchain technology, and 
            machine learning. The goal of this application is two-fold: to serve as a means to make cryptoasset market data more accessible to 
            the average investor; and also to encourage the notion of value investing in the crypto space. He has held roles at NASA
            conducting research into statistical machine learning methods for climate research (2020) and at the Blockchain Research Institute exploring DeFi 
            and its various implications in greater depth (2021-Present). In his free time, he enjoys science fiction and fantasy in all its various mediums
            (books, films, video games, etc.), running in Central Park, playing with dogs, and exploring the mobius strip that is New York City.
