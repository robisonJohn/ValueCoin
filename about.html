        <h3>What is Velocity?</h3>
        <p>There is a tremendous amount of hype surrounding cryptocurrencies in the 21st century. However, it seems at times 
            that there is simply too much information to comprehend. What are cryptocurrencies? Are they speculative assets or a 
            new anarcholibertarian means of value exchange? Are they for common people or criminals? Should you invest in crypto? 
            If so, how?
        </p>
        <p>
            This application seeks to solve one tiny piece of this puzzle: namely, how can we understand the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies?
            In principle, there are many metrics to understand the intrinsic validity of a currency: the stability of a government, the 
            level of free market freedom, its level of adoption, etc. However, for this project we are focusing on one fundamental metric: the velocity of money,
            defined as the total productive output of a currency divided by the present money supply. In words, this can be expressed by the 
            total number of transactions multiplied by the average amount exchanged per transaction divided by the total amount of currency
            presently in circulation. If transaction data is not readily available, then token market capitalization should serve as a 
            sufficient proxy for the productive output of the currency. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, the goal of this application is to source data from the LunarCrush API and calculate the following metrics for a given cryptoasset:
            <ul>
                <li>Current Price Data</li>
                <li>24-hour Price Change</li>
                <li>Velocity</li>
                <li>Number of Transactions per day</li>
                <li>Social Velocity</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The above data will provide meaningful insights into the degree to which an token is a speculative asset or a store of value relative to
            another cryptocurrency. This should thus enable users to identify coins that exhibit more stable behavior and thus pose a smaller intrinsic
            risk as an initial investment. Comparing the velocity and social velocity in particular will provide a meaningful way to identify market
            manias and ensure you (the investor) do not fall subject to the infamous "Buy High, Sell Low" Club. 
        </p>
        <p>Note: this investment strategy is fundamentally contrary to the present mode of crypto investing, which is essentially 
            high-stakes gambling focused on "punting" coins with low values so you risk low losses but stand to gain tremendously. 
            However, a value-driven investment approach on a broader level should lead to less market volatility and therefore
            greater intrinsic public trust in crypto assets as a unit of exchange rather than simply as a speculative entity.</p>

        <h3>About the Developer</h3>
        <p>This application has been developed by John Robison, a senior at Columbia University studying mathematics and statistics. His primary 
            interests include number theory and its applications to mathematical cryptography, behavorial economics, blockchain technology, and 
            machine learning. The goal of this application is two-fold: to serve as a means to make cryptoasset market data more accessible to 
            the average investor; and also to encourage the notion of value investing in the crypto space.
