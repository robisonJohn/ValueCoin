            <p>
                Ever since Satoshi Nakomoto minted the first Bitcoin, there has been incredible controvery surrounding
                crypto assets. Are they currencies or securities? Are they symbolic of a libertarian future that shakes off
                the tyrannical chains of Big Banks and totalitarian government regimes, or merely "Rat Poison" (as Warren Buffet
                famously stated)? This paper is inclined to argue the former; however, the productive capacity of crypto
                assets are fundamentally limited by the way humans choose to use them. Therefore, as long as the crypto market
                remains one dominated by booms and busts, crypto assets will never truly be able to offer the degree of stability
                necessary for people to shake free from the chains of an oppressive financial system. Ultimately, personal
                liberty is inextricably linked to financial freedom; so ensuring the stability and reliability of crypto assets
            is paramount to the mainstream adoption of crypto assets and the maximization of their utilization as a tool for 
        maximizing the agency of the individual      </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2 class="white-paper-header">Thesis: The Case for Fundamental Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Fundamental Analysis is the methodical process of analyzing an asset on its underlying essential properties
                at an atomic level and thereby deducing the soundness of an investment. This methodological mode of thought is in stark contrast to the present
                realm of crypto investing, which is largely dominated by social media-driven frenzy and "pumping and punting." To truly create
                a definitive methodology by which one could fundamentally analyze the intrinsic worth of a crypto asset and invest in 
                this asset for an extended period of time, there must be fundamental benchmarks by which we measure the performance of
                a crypto system. Naturally, an on-chain analysis of the underlying protocol is a requisite; however, this requires a steadier
                hand than this application can offer. Instead, this application identifies three fundamental financial indicators for a crypto asset that 
                may justify it as a long term investment. In addition, three social-media driven metrics are employed to capitalize on 
                the disconnect between market hysteria and market soundness. In the immortal words of Benjamin Graham, the market is 
                a popularity contest in the short-term and a weighing contest in the long term. Thus, by identifying assets with fundamentally sound 
                investment prospects that may be overlooked by media-driven hype, we can determine an optimal long-term investment approach 
                that is fundamentally contrarian in nature but is mathematically rigorous in nature.

                </ul>
                <li>Sentiment: the degree to which social media posts represent bearish or bullish sentiment (where 1 represents 
                    very bearish and 5 represent very bullish).
                </li>
                <ul>

                    <li>Social Dominance: The degree to which social media posts and reactions regard this asset versus other assets in its class</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <p>Key Financial Metrics</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Price to Earnings Ratio: the ratio of the current price level over its earnings over some time interval, <em>T</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Price: the market value of an asset</li>
                    <li>Earnings: the difference in some price, <em>P</em>, over some time interval <em>T</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Velocity: equal to the price level of an asset multiplied by the aggregate real value of transactions in a 
                    given time frame divided by the total nominal amount of money in circulation. This is equivalent to the price level 
                    squared multiplied by the transaction volume divided by the market capitalization.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transaction Volume: the number of transactions multiplied by the price associated with each transaction</li>
                    <li>Market Capitalization: the total amount of USD current invested in the particular asset.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Risk Differential: the difference between an asset's upside risk and downside risk; regarded as a metric 
                    that weighs potential gains against potential losses. A negative value suggests the downside risk is greater 
                    than the upside risk and thus the asset is likely not a reliable investment. A positive value suggests the upside risk is greater
                    than the downside risk and thus the asset is a potentially sound investment
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Volatility: the standard deviation of an asset's price</li>
                    <li>Downside Risk: the standard deviation of an asset's losses</li>
                    <li>Upside Risk: the standard deviation of an asset's gains</li>
                </ul>
