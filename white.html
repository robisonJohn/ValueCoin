        <p>
            Ever since Satoshi Nakomoto minted the first Bitcoin, there has been incredible controvery surrounding
            crypto assets. Are they currencies or securities? Are they symbolic of a libertarian future that shakes off
            the tyrannical chains of Big Banks and totalitarian government regimes, or merely "Rat Poison" as Warren Buffet
            famously stated. This paper is inclined to argue the former; however, the productive capacity of crypto
            assets are fundamentally limited by the way humans choose to use them. Therefore, as long as the crypto market
            remains one dominated by booms and busts, crypto assets will never truly be able to offer the degree of stability
            necessary for people to shake free from the chains of an oppressive financial system. Ultimately, personal
            liberty is inextricably linked to financial freedom; so ensuring the stability and reliability of crypto assets
        is paramount to the mainstream adoption of crypto assets.        </p>

        <h2 class="white-paper-header">Thesis: The Case for Fundamental Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Fundamental Analysis is the methodical process of analyzing an asset on its underlying essential properties
            at an atomic level and thereby deducing the soundness of an investment. This is in stark contrast to the present
            realm of crypto investing, which is largely dominated by social media-driven frenzy and "punting." To truly create
            a definitive methodology by which one could fundamentally analyze the intrinsic worth of a crypto asset and invest in 
            this asset for an extended period of time, there must be fundamental benchmarks by which we measure the performance of
            a crypto system. Naturally, an on-chain analysis of the underlying protocol is a requisite; however, this requires a steadier
            hand than this application can offer. Instead, this application identifies three fundamental financial indicators for a crypto asset that 
            may justify it as a long term investment. In addition, three social-media driven metrics are employed to capitalize on 
            the disconnect between market hysteria and market soundness. In the immortal words of Benjamin Graham, the market is 
            a popularity contest in the short-term and a weighing contest in the long term. Thus, by identifying assets with fundamentally sound 
            investment prospects that may be overlooked by media-driven hype, we can determine an optimal long-term investment approach 
            that is fundamentally contrarian in nature.
